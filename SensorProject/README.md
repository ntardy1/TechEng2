# FindMy
This project was designed to imitate Apple's "Find My iPhone" feature, but using a Raspberry Pi and Matlab to locate an iPhone.

# Snake
This is exactly what it sounds like: programming a snake game that can be played on the LED matrix of the Raspberry Pi sense hat using the joystick as the control.
